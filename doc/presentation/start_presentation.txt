    .. revealjs:: What is OSGeoLive?

        .. image:: ../images/projects/osgeolive/osgeolive_menu.png

    .. revealjs:: Components on OSGeoLive

        * 50+ Open Source Geospatial Applications.
        * Sample Datasets.
        * Consistent Overviews & Quickstarts.
        * Translations.


        .. rv_note::
            Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

    .. revealjs:: DVD / USB / Virtual Machine

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive can also be run from a DVD, USB flash drive, installed into a Virtual Machine, or installed onto your hard drive.
            This presentation provides a lightning overview of all applications installed on OSGeoLive, which effectively gives you a birds eye view of the breadth of robust GeoSpatial Open Source Software available.

    .. revealjs:: Quality Criteria

        * Established, stable, working software
        * Active community
        * `Metrics <https://live.osgeo.org/en/metrics.html>`__

        .. image:: ../images/presentation/metrics.png
            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive helps new users quickly find quality GIS applications from the myriads of options.
            OSGeoLive only accepts established open source projects, and users can then verify the application works by running it on OSGeoLive.
            This slide shows the OpenHUB metrics page, which shows the community size and activity.

    .. revealjs:: Production & Marketing Pipeline

        .. image:: ../images/presentation/pipeline.png
            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            * OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.
            * Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeoLive get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.
            * Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.
            * Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.
            * Conference organisers welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeoLive during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeoLive DVD or USB.
            * Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.
            * Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.

    .. revealjs:: Reboot for 11.0</h2>

        * Reduced scope of OSGeoLive 11.0 release
        * Reviewed all projects, focusing on quality of documentation
        * Rebaselined to focus on leading applications
        * Dropped:

          * Windows-only applications/installers
          * Overviews of OGC Standards
          * Quickstarts of Libraries
          * Some applications that did not meet our review criteria

        * Only support a 64 bit distribution (32 bit is built but not officially supported)

        .. rv_note::

            In OSGeoLive Version 11.0 no new projects were included. We reduced our scope in order to meet the level of effort provided by our volunteers.

    .. revealjs:: What is new in 11.0</h2>

        * Re-based to Lubuntu 16.04.2
        * Updated core packages based on DebianGIS
        * Major documentation updates
        * Work being done to move translations to Transifex for 12.0
        * Embraced OSGeo re-branding
        * Full `changelog <href="https://github.com/OSGeo/OSGeoLive/blob/master/CHANGES.txt">`__
        * Updated packages will soon land in UbuntuGIS

        .. rv_note::
            In OSGeoLive Version 11.0 we updated many existing applications.

            Set up in 2006, the OSGeo Foundation is non-profit for the geospatial community which fosters an open approach to software, standards, education, research and data.
            It supports with advocacy, events, organisation and legal matters.
            OSGeoLive derives its name from the Open Source GeoSpatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short.

        .. rv_note::
            * Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source projects when defining reference implementations for standards.
            * OSGeoLive includes overviews of some of the key OGC standards in simple language so they can be understood by people without a technical background.
            * Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications.
            * It facilitates sharing data between agencies.
            * It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance,
            * and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.

    .. rv_note::
        We'll now look at Web Services. Web Services are accessed via a URL, and return map data in various formats. Data is primarily accessed via OGC standards-based interfaces, including Web Map Services for images, Web Feature Services for vector data and Catalog Services for the Web for Metadata.
